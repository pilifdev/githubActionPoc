# Prerequisites
- Go to https://github.com/pilif42/githubActionPoc/settings/secrets/actions
- Add Environment secrets:
    - env = dev: TSANDCS_HOST, TSANDCS_SSH_USER, PORT & KEY
    - same thing for env = test.


# Strategy
- Have a branch per environment (dev, test, etc.). For this poc, we have only one branch main which is for dev. 
In poc.yml, for a given job (see tagAndRelease), we set the target environment (see name: dev). It will be used to pull the correct credentials.
- When we want to upload new Ts & Cs for a given environment, we just do a PR to its branch and when merged, thanks to the 
'on push' defined in poc.yml, the workflow will be triggered.


# Workflow
- Defined in .github/workflows/poc.yml

- References used:
    - https://github.com/pandoc/pandoc-action-example/blob/master/.github/workflows/advanced.yml
    - https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/guides/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts
    - https://github.com/appleboy/scp-action
    - https://github.com/mathieudutour/github-tag-action

- Note on the tag creation:
    - v0.0.1 was created with commit message = fix(pencil): downgrading to v5 as no tag generated with v5.1
        - convention to follow for the commit msg is explained at https://github.com/mathieudutour/github-tag-action#bumping
    - v0.0.2 is an anomaly. It was created with commit msg = tidying the README
        - this was before I added default_bump: false.
        - now, if you do not follow the commit convention, the workflow will fail. See commit msg = to limit the retention time on the version file and to test default_bump
    - if you do not want the tagging to happen, use the option dry_run described at https://github.com/mathieudutour/github-tag-action#debugging.


# To work out all existing tags and determine the latest tag
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"  https://api.github.com/repos/pilif42/githubActionPoc/git/refs/tags
Then, when you have the tag 'v0.0.19', simply GET to https://github.com/pilif42/githubActionPoc/blob/v0.0.19/termsAndConditions.html


# TODOs
- Rather than hardcoding 'TsAndCs updated' for the commit message, identify the commit message which triggered the workflow and reuse it here.
